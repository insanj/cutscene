## Install

Built with Typescript, compiled for use in any modern browser through the `OogyCutscene.min.js` file.

```js
import { OogyCutscene } from "OogyCutscene.min.js";
```

```html
<script src="OogyCutscene.min.js"></script>
```

For development or Node.js use:

```bash
npm install oogy-cutscene
```


## Usage

To learn how to use this module, check out [OogyCutscene.ts](src/OogyCutscene.ts), which is full of documentation and comments about how to use the API and what its full capabilities are.

See [example/](example/) as well as the `package.json` command `npm run example` for a demo of it in action. Below, a snippet of the example's [index.html](example/index.html):

```html
<script type="module">
  import { 
    OogyCutscene
  } from "/dist/OogyCutscene.min.js";

  const element = document.getElementById("dialogue");
  const text = "Hello, Github! This is oogy-cutscene, a simple but powerful tool for web-based video games.";
  
  const task = {
    element,
    text
  }; // this is a OogyCutsceneTask, but used in a pure JS context

  const performer = new OogyCutscene.OogyCutscenePerformer();

  console.log("oogy-cutscene example is starting its performance", task, performer);
  performer.perform(performer)
    .then(() => {
      console.log("oogy-cutscene example has finished its performance", performer);
    })
    .catch(e => {
      console.error(e);
    });
</script>
```

## Development

To begin development on this module, clone the repo and run `npm install` to grab all the needed development dependencies. Then, use `npm start` to turn the `src/*.ts` -> `dist/*.js`, then use `npm run release` to turn the `.js` to `.min.js`. See `package.json` to learn how these scripts work.

It can be helpful to make sure your IDE is using the same Typescript version as `package.json`. For example, in Visual Studio Code, open a `.ts` file and use the shortcut SHIFT+COMMAND+P and choose `TypeScript: > Select TypeScript Version...`.
