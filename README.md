## Install

Built with Typescript, compiled for use in any modern browser through the `OogyCutscene.min.js` file.

```js
import { OogyCutscene } from "OogyCutscene.min.js";
```

```html
<script src="OogyCutscene.min.js"></script>
```

For development or Node.js use:

```bash
npm install oogy-cutscene
```


## Usage

See [example/](example/) as well as the `package.json` command `npm run example`.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { 
    OogyCutscene
  } from "../dist/OogyCutscene.min.js";

  const element = document.getElementById("dialogue");
  const text = "Hello, Github! This is oogy-cutscene, a simple but powerful tool for web-based video games.";
  
  const task = {
    element,
    text
  }; // OogyCutsceneTask

  const performer = new OogyCutscene.OogyCutscenePerformer();

  console.log("oogy-cutscene example is starting its performance", task, performer);
  performer.perform(performer)
    .then(() => {
      console.log("oogy-cutscene example has finished its performance", performer);
    })
    .catch(e => {
      console.error(e);
    });
</script>
```

## Development

It can be helpful to make sure your IDE is using the same Typescript version as `package.json`. For example, in Visual Studio Code, open a `.ts` file and use the shortcut SHIFT+COMMAND+P and choose `TypeScript: > Select TypeScript Version...`.
